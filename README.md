**Introduction**

This coding challenge is designed to understand how you think about a problem and how you solve it. We'll be reviewing your code to understand how you structure and implement your solution.

**The Problem**

We are a parking technology company, so we figured we should make our coding challenge about parking.

We need you to build a system that counts cars in a given parking location. At many locations, the count is used to determine whether a garage is full or not, so we need a system that can reliably keep track of vehicle counts and present that information to people driving up to the location.

**Deliverables**

To solve the problem, we would like you to build two things:

_API_

There needs to be an API that can support adding and removing vehicles from the count. You can add other functions to it to support this functionality if necessary.

_Interface_

An interface needs to exist to actually display the vehicle count for the location.

**Assumptions**

- Sensors and a kiosk will handle actually calling the API you provide, you do not need to write anything that calls it.
- You can write the two deliverables using whatever technologies you deem necessary. 
- The interface will be browser-based, assume the display will be running a Chrome window.


**Delivering Your Solution**

To get started, fork this repository into your own git repo.

When you are done and ready for review, simply email us a link to your repo and our team will review your solution.

Thanks for taking the time to complete the challenge, we will follow up with you shortly after you submit your solution.
